# Proposals
For my final project, I would like to collect information from Yelp and Google Map about bubble milk tea shops in Chicago, including their locations, products and prices, ratings and reviews, etc, and analyze these data to see what makes a bubble milk tea shop have high or low ratings. 

Born and raised in Taiwan, I personally love bubble milk tea. But sometimes online ratings and reviews of a bubble milk tea shop may only reflect one aspect of its milk tea (location, price, milk tea sweetness, bubble tasty or not...). I would like to conduct analysis on data on bubble milk tea shops in Chicago, and see if their ratings on Yelp and Google Map were influenced by the characteristics of the shop and the demographics of the neighborhood/customers. 

To-do list:
- Access data from Yelp fusion API and Google Maps Places API, and filter data for bubble milk tea shops in Chicago
- Analyze these data to locate which area in Chicago has the most and best bubble milk tea shops, in terms of ratings, price, and the variety of products. 
- What are the key factors that make a high rating on Yelp versus Google Map?
- What are the distributions of age, gender, race and ethnicity groups in each area, and would these variables have any correlation with the ratings, products or prices of local milk tea shops?


# Execution Plan
1. By the end of week 5, I will have collected bubble milk tea shop data from Yelp API and Google Map API, as well as neighborhood demographics from Citfy of Chicago data portal. 

2. By the end of week 6, I will have cleaned all datasets, prepared data for analysis, and completed exploratory data analysis.

3. By the end of week 7, I will conduct analysis to explore correlation between shops characteristics and ratings, and correlation between neighborhood demographics and ratings. 

4. By the end of week 8, I will have finished all data analyses and report.
