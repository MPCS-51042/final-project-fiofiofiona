# Proposals
My ideas for my final project are: How are food consumptions associated with happiness levels across different countries? 

Food is one of the necessary elements in human life; in addition to providing energy that supports our physical mechanisms, can food also influence our mental condition? I would like to conduct an analysis on food consumption vs. happiness: does eating more sugar, fats, or healthy nutrients associate with higher levels of happiness? During the pandemic time, how did happiness and food consumption change across different countries? 

To-do list:
- Access food consumption dataset from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations)
- Access food security data from USDA
- Access happiness index from World Happiness Report
- Explore the relationship between food/nutrients consumption and happiness -- any certain kind of nutrients is more likely associated with higher happiness index?
- Explore the relationship between food (in)security and food consumption
- How were the happiness indices changed before and after COVID-19 in different countries? How was this change related to the change in food consumption and security over the same course of time? (2019 vs. 2020 vs. 2021) 

# Execution Plan
1. By the end of week 4, I will have collected food consumption data, food secrity data, and happiness level data across countries from 2016 to 2021

2. By the end of week 5, I will have cleaned all datasets and prepare data for analysis.

3. By the end of week 6, I will have completed exploratory data analysis.

4. By the end of week 7, I will conduct analysis to explore correlation between food consumption and food security, food consumption and happiness indices. I will also focus on years before and after COVID-19 pandemic. 

5. By the end of week 8, I will have finished all data analyses and report.
